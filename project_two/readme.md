**NOTES**

```
Governs how we perform tasks that take sometime to complete
(Getting data from a database)

Its code that can start now and finish later.


Javascript by default is a singel threaded language
One statement can be executed at a time

It is synchoronous by nature

If we want it to execute asynchronously we introduce another
function called a callback

The callback  is passed into a different thread which allows
the code to continue to execute.
